# password-generator

## Description

This is a password generator I wrote the javaScript for to help further my understanding of how javaScripts works.
The HTML and CSS were provided for me.

This project helped me understand how funtions, arrays, if statments, and for loops worked as I had to use all of them to get my code working as required.

## Usage

To generate a password click the "Generate Password" button. You will then be prompted with a series of prompts asking you to define the parameters of your new password.
Once all parameters have been satisfied a password matching your chosen criteria is displayed in the password box.

## Credits

I'd like to thank my study group especially Jared for helping me understand the javaScript and not just giving me answers but actually working with me to make sure I understood what I was typing.
